# CLI reference

Run `herdr-boss` with no arguments to print a short usage list. Commands that change state print JSON or one status line. Errors go to standard error with a non-zero exit code.

Run project commands (`worker`, `worktree`, `ledger`, `check`, `gh`) from inside the project repository. They read `.herdr-boss.json` from the repository root.

## Service

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `herdr-boss install` | Install and start the macOS launchd agent `no.tallmaker.herdr-boss`. Run it again after you move the repository. |
| `herdr-boss uninstall` | Stop and remove the launchd agent. |
| `herdr-boss serve` | Run the collector and the dashboard in the foreground. |
| `herdr-boss serve --read-only-preview` | Run a dashboard preview. This mode allows API reads and blocks API changes, prompts, notifications, process reaping, handovers, and browser launches. It needs a `HERDR_BOSS_DIR` that the service does not use. |
| `herdr-boss tick [--json]` | Collect once and print alerts. Sends no prompt and stops no process. `--json` prints the full snapshot. |
| `herdr-boss logs` | Print the last 100 lines of the server log. |
| `herdr-boss kit-path` | Print the path of the shared kit (skill, templates, model list). |

Restart the service after a configuration change:

```sh
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/no.tallmaker.herdr-boss
```

Start a dashboard preview with temporary data and a separate local port:

```sh
HERDR_BOSS_DIR="$(mktemp -d)" HERDR_BOSS_PORT=4478 npm start -- --read-only-preview
```

Choose an unused local port if 4478 is busy.

`HERDR_BOSS_DIR` selects the data directory. The live data directory defaults to `~/.herdr-boss`. Set `HERDR_BOSS_LIVE_DIR` when the service uses another live directory.

A preview collects and evaluates, so it writes `state.json`, `rules.json`, `bulletin.md`, and quota history into its data directory. A preview therefore requires `HERDR_BOSS_DIR` to name a separate directory that the service does not use. The directory does not have to be empty. A directory that holds files from an earlier preview is valid. The command refuses to start when `HERDR_BOSS_DIR` is unset, when it resolves to the live data directory, when it resolves to `~/.herdr-boss`, or when a symlink in the path resolves to either of them. The refusal happens before the command creates or migrates a data directory. Use a separate `HERDR_BOSS_LIVE_DIR` value in the preview process to point the check at another live directory.

When `NODE_TEST_CONTEXT` is set, or the data directory differs from the configured live directory, the Engine disables prompts, notifications, process reaping, and handovers. Set `HERDR_BOSS_ALLOW_ACTIONS=1` only when you intentionally need these actions outside the live service.

## Resources and policy

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `herdr-boss lanes` | Show the active Owner state, machine CPU and threshold, 5-minute load and backstop, then one line per quota provider, then the unmetered models lane. |
| `herdr-boss models [--kind KIND]` | The allowed harnesses, models, and efforts from `kit/models.json`. |
| `herdr-boss policy show` | Print the resource policy (`~/.herdr-boss/policy.json`). |
| `herdr-boss policy set FILE` | Validate and replace the policy. The service applies it on the next tick. |
| `herdr-boss usage record FILE` | Add one measured or unmeasured usage event. |
| `herdr-boss usage summary` | Usage per project and provider. |

## Project status

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `herdr-boss publish SLUG FILE` | Validate a status file and install it for `/projects/SLUG`. Use `-` for standard input. Schema: [project-status.md](project-status.md). |
| `herdr-boss scratch SLUG` | Create `~/.herdr-boss/scratch/SLUG/` if it does not exist, and print its absolute path. `HERDR_BOSS_DIR` replaces `~/.herdr-boss`. |

## Workers

### `worker start NAME`

Create a branch and worktree, write the brief, open a pane in the `Workers` tab, start the agent, and send the brief.

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--kind KIND` | Required. `codex`, `claude`, `opencode`, or `pi`. |
| `--task TEXT` or `--task-file FILE` | Required. The work order for the brief. |
| `--allow PATH` | A path that the worker may change. Repeat for each path. |
| `--model MODEL` | A model from `herdr-boss models`. The default is the kind's default model. |
| `--effort EFFORT` | A reasoning effort, where the kind supports it. |
| `--issue N` | The issue number. |
| `--base BRANCH` | The base branch. The default is `baseBranch` in `.herdr-boss.json`. |
| `--orch PANE` | The verified caller pane for reports. If set, it must match `HERDR_PANE_ID`. |
| `--no-worktree` | Use the current checkout. The worker gets `.worker/NAME/` for its brief and reports. |
| `--dry-run` | Print the plan. Change nothing. |
| `--force` | Override quota, capacity, and paused-project refusals. It cannot enable a disabled model. |

`worker start` refuses a provider that is ahead of pace or near exhaustion. The refusal names the same window as `herdr-boss lanes`. When every metered provider is ahead of pace, it allows the least-over one with a notice. A refusal or least-over notice lists the current project's unmetered alternatives first, then names the least-over metered provider. It refuses dispatch when the active CPU limit or enabled load backstop is exceeded. `--force` cannot bypass a machine refusal.

Policy may set `preferredModels` by harness, `modelProviders` by allowed model, and `pacingGoals` by provider and window key (`primary`, `secondary`, or `tertiary`). A preferred model must be in that harness's allow-list. A provider route must be `codex`, `claude`, `opencodego`, or `null` for an unmetered model. A pacing goal is a whole percentage from 0 to 100; an absent goal means 100%. Explicit `--model` and handoff `--model` choices take precedence.

```sh
herdr-boss worker start fix-74 --kind claude --task-file brief.md --allow src/parse/ --issue 74
```

### Other worker commands

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `worker list` | Unfinished run records with the live agent status. |
| `worker collect NAME` | Read the worker report and check its changed paths against `--allow`. |
| `worker collect NAME --record --outcome done\|partial\|failed --gate-passed\|--gate-failed [--defects N] [--rework N]` | Also append the run to the ledger and record usage. |
| `worker park NAME --reason TEXT` | Mark a worker that waits on purpose. Idle notices skip it. |
| `worker unpark NAME` | Clear the park mark. |

## Ledger, checks, and worktrees

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `ledger append --entry FILE [--file LEDGER]` | Validate and append one run entry. |
| `ledger check [--runs] [--file LEDGER]` | Validate the ledger. `--runs` also fails for each run record without a ledger entry. |
| `check --report FILE` | Validate a worker report (`report.json`). |
| `check --run FILE` | Validate one ledger entry. |
| `check --worktree DIR --allow PATH...` | Check that the worktree changes only allowed paths. |
| `worktree prune [--apply]` | List worktrees that are clean, merged, and have no live pane. `--apply` removes them. |
| `gh issue create\|comment\|edit ... --body-file FILE` | Run a GitHub issue command. An inline `--body` is refused. |

## Browsers

Each project has one persistent Chrome profile on a port from 9223 to 9299. Add `--tab ID` to page commands when the browser has several tabs; `browser tabs` lists the IDs.

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `browser request SLUG [--headless\|--visible] [--reserve]` | Launch the project browser. `--reserve` assigns the port and profile only. |
| `browser list` | All project browsers, ports, profiles, and state. |
| `browser restart SLUG --headless\|--visible [--no-restore]` | Close and relaunch in the other mode. The current page reopens unless `--no-restore`. |
| `browser close SLUG` | Close the browser. The profile stays. |
| `browser size SLUG WIDTH HEIGHT` | Window size for the next launch (320–3840 × 240–2160). |
| `browser tabs SLUG` | Tabs with ID, title, URL, visibility, and whether an agent is attached. |
| `browser tab new SLUG [URL]` | Open a tab in its own background window. Prints the ID. |
| `browser tab close SLUG --tab ID [--force]` | Close a tab. Refuses a tab an agent is attached to unless `--force`. |
| `browser screenshot SLUG [--tab ID] [--out DIR]` | Save a private JPEG and print its path. Use `$TMPDIR` by default, or select a directory with `--out DIR`. |
| `browser navigate SLUG URL [--tab ID]` | Open an `http` or `https` page. |
| `browser click SLUG X% Y% [--tab ID]` | Click at a position relative to the screenshot. |
| `browser text SLUG --stdin [--tab ID]` | Type text from standard input. The text is not echoed. |
| `browser key SLUG KEY [--tab ID]` | Send `Tab`, `Enter`, `Backspace`, `Delete`, `Escape`, `Home`, `End`, an arrow key, or `SelectAll`. |

```sh
id=$(herdr-boss browser tab new tmprocessmining | jq -r .id)
herdr-boss browser navigate tmprocessmining https://example.com --tab "$id"
herdr-boss browser screenshot tmprocessmining --tab "$id"
```

The screenshot command writes under `$TMPDIR` when it is set. Otherwise, it creates a safe temporary directory. Pass `--out DIR` to choose an output directory. This option overrides `$TMPDIR` and can be used with `--tab`.

## Orchestrator handover

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `handoff plan PANE --to KIND [--model M] [--effort E] [--mode migrate\|fresh]` | Check the target and whether session migration is available. Changes nothing. |
| `handoff prepare PANE --to KIND [...]` | Start a successor in a new `Orchestrator Next` tab. The source keeps control. |
| `handoff activate ID --confirmed` | Move the `orch` or `boss` label to the successor. The source pane becomes `standby`. |
| `handoff ready ID` | Sent by an automatic successor when it is ready. |
| `handoff list` | All handover records. |

`--mode migrate` (the default) converts the session with `session-migrate`. When that is not possible, use `--mode fresh`; the successor starts from the project files and the source pane. `--force` allows a target provider near exhaustion.
